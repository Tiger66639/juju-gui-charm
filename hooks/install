# Debian packages:
# language-pack-en: required by pip;
# python-minimal: the charm hooks are written in Python2;
# python-apt: used to calculate additional required debian packages;
# python-pip: used to install GUI server and Juju GUI deps;
# python-setuptools: used by GUI server and Juju GUI setup.py files;
# python-six: required by charm tools;
# python-tempita: used to render config files;
# python-yaml: Juju speaks yaml;
# python-zope.deprecation and python-zope.interface are required by the Juju
# GUI (both packages) and by the GUI server (just the interface one), and
# installed globally so that we don't end up with a top level zope package not
# including both deprecation and interface subpackages, which can happen in the
# case one package is installed with apt and the other with pip.
